## Linear Regression

Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis. The goal of linear regression is to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome.

## Decision Trees

A decision tree is a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility.

## Random Forest

Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

## Naive Bayes

In machine learning, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.

## K-Nearest Neighbors

In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method proposed by Thomas Cover used for classification and regression.

## Support Vector Machines

In machine learning, support-vector machines are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis.
